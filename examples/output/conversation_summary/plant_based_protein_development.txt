# Plant-Based Protein Development Summary

## Protein Sources and Ratios
- **Primary Source**: Pea protein (70%)
  - Rich in lysine and essential amino acids
- **Secondary Source**: Rice protein (30%)
  - High in methionine, complementing pea protein
- **Combined Benefits**: Balanced amino acid profile and enhanced protein quality

## Testing Methods
### In-Vitro Testing
- Selected Method: INFOGEST protocol
- Benefit: Effectively simulates human digestion

### In-Vivo Testing
- Selected Method: Animal models
- Benefit: Provides comprehensive data on protein quality

## Key Parameters to Measure
1. Protein digestibility
2. Amino acid profiles
3. Overall protein quality
4. PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score)

## Next Steps
### Timeline Development
- Create detailed study timeline
- Plan resource allocation

### Required Resources
1. Laboratory Equipment
2. Research Personnel
3. INFOGEST Method Materials
4. Animal Care Facilities

## Conclusion
The team has agreed on a 70:30 pea-to-rice protein ratio and established a comprehensive testing approach using both in-vitro and in-vivo methods. The next phase involves detailed planning of resources and timeline for the digestibility studies.
